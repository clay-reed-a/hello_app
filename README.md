App 1: Hello, World! 
---

[The Rails Tutorial][rails] by [Michael Hartl][hartl] has taught me so many things: 

1. It taught me how to make Rails say "Hello, World!"
+ It taught me about DSLs. 
+ It taught me about MVC.
+ And about models talking to databases. 
+ And about controllers handling requests. 
+ And views and stuff. 
+ And David Heinemeier Hansson. 
+ It also taught me how to use `git`. 
+ And about Mr. Creosote.
